                    At Volsgaard, since 1997 we have been breeding with Danish landrace and since then we have been breeding with Duroc and Landrace.
                    Volsgaard's customers include both Danish and foreign pig producers and KS stations.
                    We have customers both locally in Central and Western Jutland, and in the rest of Denmark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Responsible for the holdings is Tommy Volsgaard, who has more than 25 years of experience in the industry.
                    He and Volsgaard's employees ensure a common thread in work processes and provide great well-being for the animals.
                    In addition to pig breeding and propagation, Volsgaard also runs 300 hectares of plant breeding with seeds and grains.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Among other things, we make sure that the breeding animals walk on a large and fixed floor area, which is good for their hooves.
                    In addition, the breeding animals receive ample amounts of straw every day as well as home-made feed, which results in a pig breeding consisting of strong and healthy breeding animals.
                    In our pig breeding, we also have close contact with the breeding animals every day to avoid human-shy breeding animals.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    We breed pigs near Holstebro and Herning, where the focus is on a good local environment and quality feed.
                    We offer good and healthy pig farming
                    We deliver high-quality pig breeding, and you can therefore safely rely on being delivered both happy and healthy breeding animals.

                    Pig breeding is the process of reproducing and raising pigs for meat, leather, and other products. The process begins with selecting the appropriate breeding stock, which includes boars (male pigs) and sows (female pigs). Boars are typically chosen for their genetic traits, such as growth rate, meat quality, and fertility, while sows are selected for their reproductive performance and mothering abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the breeding stock is selected, the boar and sow are brought together for mating. This can be done naturally, through artificial insemination, or a combination of both. The sow will typically have a gestation period of about 114 days, after which she will give birth to a litter of piglets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After birth, the piglets are fed and cared for by the sow, and will usually be weaned around 4-8 weeks of age. They will then be moved to a separate area for growth and finishing, where they will be fed a diet specifically formulated for their growth and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the piglets grow, they will be regularly monitored for health and growth, and may be treated with antibiotics, vaccines, and other medications as needed. They will also be regularly weighed and measured to track their progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the piglets reach maturity, they will be sent to a finishing farm where they will be fed a diet specifically formulated for meat production. This diet will typically include high levels of protein, energy, and other nutrients to promote growth and meat quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the pigs have reached the desired weight and size, they will be sent to a processing plant where they will be slaughtered and processed into pork products. The pork products will then be packaged and sent to market for consumers to purchase.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Overall, pig breeding is a complex process that requires a combination of knowledge and skills, including proper nutrition, health management, and housing. It also requires dedication, hard work and patience. Pig breeding process is regulated by laws and regulations to ensure the welfare of the animals and the safety of the food.

                As a customer of LOGO , you get the best of the best. 
                We have a newer stable facility, where the oldest stable building is from 1997. Our poults grow up on floor areas where at least 50% is solid, feeding is restricted and all animals are given a daily allocation of straw. This means that we get robust studs and breeding animals, and this results in very few complaints from our customers. 
                We mix all feed in-house, and this ensures a salmonella index of 0.0.
                Employees: both Danish students, unskilled and skilled employees.
                Our employees have a large share in our good results, they are our most important resource.
                We constantly strive to maintain and develop an attractive workplace.
                Our teams are made up of skilled and unskilled employees, students who are currently studying farming and 2 interns from Ukraine - all skilled and thoroughly trained to handle the systematization and note-taking discipline that is necessary in a breeding and reproduction herd.

            <div class="hidden" id="history">
                <p>
                    The history of pig farming can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as the Chinese and Egyptians, who kept pigs for food and other uses. Today, pig farming is a major industry in many countries, with China, the United States, and Brazil being the top producers of pork.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    Raising pigs requires a combination of knowledge and skills, including proper nutrition, health management, and housing. Feed is one of the most important factors in pig farming, as it provides the necessary nutrients for growth and production. Pigs are omnivores and can eat a wide range of foods, including grains, protein sources, and by-products from other industries.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Proper health management is also crucial for pig farming. This includes regular check-ups and vaccinations to prevent and control diseases, as well as proper sanitation to maintain a clean and hygienic environment. Pigs are also susceptible to internal and external parasites, which must be controlled through regular deworming and other treatments.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Housing is another important aspect of pig farming. Pigs need to be protected from extreme weather conditions and provided with a comfortable and safe environment. This can include barns, sheds, or other structures, as well as bedding and other materials to keep the pigs warm and dry.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Pig farming can also be done in an environmentally sustainable way. This can include using renewable energy sources, reducing waste and pollution, and protecting natural resources. Many pig farmers are also implementing sustainable practices such as using natural lighting, ventilation, and insulation to reduce energy consumption.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    There are different types of pig farming systems, depending on the scale and purpose of the operation. Some pig farms are focused on breeding and raising pigs for meat, while others may also produce pork products such as bacon and ham. Large commercial pig farms typically use intensive farming methods, while small-scale farmers may use more extensive or free-range systems.
